'''REMOVE DUPLICATES FROM SORTED ARRAY'''
# Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
# Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.
# Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.
# Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# Custom Judge:
# The judge will test your solution with the following code:
# int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
# int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length
# int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation
# assert k == expectedNums.length;
# for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
#     assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
# }
# If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        k = 1
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
                nums[k] = nums[i]

'''BEST TIME TO BUY AND SELL A STOCK II'''
# You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
# On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
# Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

# Example 1:
# Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
# Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
# Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            if prices[i] > prices[i-1]:
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]

'''ROTATE ARRAY'''
# Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
# Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
# Explanation:
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
# rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        k %= len(nums)
        nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]

'''CONTAINS DUPLICATE'''
# Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if nums[i] == nums[i+1]:
                return True
        
        return False
