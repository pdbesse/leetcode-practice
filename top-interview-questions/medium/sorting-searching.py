'''SORTING COLORS'''
# Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
# We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
# You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

# Example 1:
#     Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
#     Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

# Example 2:
#     Input: nums = [2,0,1]
#     Output: [0,1,2]

# Constraints:
#     n == nums.length
#     1 <= n <= 300
#     nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

# Follow up: Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

# Hints:
#     - A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
#     - Iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's.
#     - Overwrite array with the total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.

For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
# Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
